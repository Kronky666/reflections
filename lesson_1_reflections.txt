How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By showing the difference.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Save time and nerves.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: normally you will know when a commit is needed.
    Con: you think you will never forget anything so you do not have to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Cause they are better.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    In the right folder, enter git log. git diff and the 2 commits "SN" to compare.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Vision control should replace me with a better coder.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Shit, I can not use Git, cause I am flying and can not use my computer. I feel sooo free having Git now. I am not frighting to make large changes(if I will ever reach my computer).
